# LakeSuperiorStream
This project was completed as part of a Software Analysis and Design course. The assignment tasked us with developing a program capable of reading various file formats, although, for the project's scope, we focused on CSV files related to Lake Superior streams. While not required, we decided to create a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to improve the user experience.

The program's primary functionality involves prompting the user for a date and then searching for the closest corresponding date in human observations, presenting relevant sampling information. Additionally, the program performs a comparison with sensor readings within the day found. The GUI displays the averages of sensor fields, providing a user-friendly visual representation. In the end, the program assesses the data for any irregularities and flags potentially erroneous information.
