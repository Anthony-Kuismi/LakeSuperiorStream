# LakeSuperiorStream
This was from an in class project in Software Anaylsis and Design. The assignement was to create a program that can read in files of any format, but for now just csv files about lake superior streams.
We were not required to use a GUI but we used a Gui to help give the user a better interface.
Then with this data read in you prompt the user for a date and search through and find closest date in human observations and show relevant sampling information.
After that, it compares it to a sensor readings within a day. The gui shows the averages of fields from the sensor.
Finally it displays if the data needs to be checked by flagging bad information.
